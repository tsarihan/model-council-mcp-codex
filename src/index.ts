/**
 * model-council-mcp — MCP server
 *
 * Tools exposed:
 *   list_models        — discover available models across all configured providers
 *   configure_council  — set council members, judge, mode, and deconflict rounds
 *   ask_council        — query the council (individual | categorized | deconflicted | pooled | dialectic)
 *   ask_council_async  — start a council run in the background, return a job_id
 *   get_council_result — fetch / list background council runs
 *   get_council_config — inspect current council configuration
 *   council_status     — detected environment, members, tiers, quota
 *   setup_council      — set subscription tiers + auto-populate
 *
 * ask_council / ask_council_async also accept `context` (inline text), `files`
 * (local paths), and `git_ref` (auto-attaches a local `git diff` — see
 * src/git.ts) to attach as labelled context for every member; `full_repo_access`
 * (WARNING: read-only repo-wide browse access for claude-cli/codex-cli members
 * only — see CompletionOptions.fullRepoAccess in providers/base.ts); and
 * `images` (local image paths) which are routed only to council members
 * auto-detected as vision-capable (see src/images.ts, providers/*.supportsVision).
